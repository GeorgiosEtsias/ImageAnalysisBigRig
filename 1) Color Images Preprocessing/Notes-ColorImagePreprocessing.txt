ColorImagePreprocessing
-1- reads all color images from a single 'ColorImages' file
-2- Creates a greyscale scale image for each RGB one, and use it to
calculate the lower right corner of the sndbox with spatoriginColor
function
-3- Incorporates option for median filtering of colored image keeping 
the original as well
-4- Spatial Syncronisation is achieved for the greyscale and RGB ima-
ges alike.
-5- final result is array structure with 5 versions of each image
RGB/median filtered RGB/R/G/B/greyscale
-6- Processed images can be plotted
